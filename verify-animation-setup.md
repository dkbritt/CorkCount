# ✅ Animation Implementation Summary

## 🎬 Hero Section Animation
- **Animation plays only once**: Added `animation-iteration-count: 1`
- **No repetition**: Added `animation-fill-mode: forwards` 
- **No scroll triggers**: Animation only runs on initial page load
- **Smooth completion**: Uses `ease-out` timing and `forwards` fill mode

## 🍇 Wine Card Scroll Animation  
- **Intersection Observer Hook**: Created `use-intersection-observer.ts`
- **Scroll-triggered**: Cards animate when entering viewport
- **One-time animation**: `triggerOnce: true` prevents re-animation
- **Subtle effects**: Fade-in + scale-up + slide-up with `ease-out`
- **Staggered delays**: Each card has `index * 0.1s` delay
- **Performance optimized**: Uses CSS transitions with `transform` and `opacity`

## ♿ Accessibility Features
- **Reduced motion support**: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
- **No layout interference**: Animations don't affect document flow
- **Smooth performance**: Hardware-accelerated properties only

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. `client/global.css` - Hero and card animation styles
2. `client/hooks/use-intersection-observer.ts` - Scroll detection
3. `client/components/WineCard.tsx` - Animation integration
4. `client/pages/Index.tsx` - Staggered card delays

### Animation Properties:
- **Hero**: 1.2s fade-in with staggered delays (0.2s intervals)
- **Cards**: 0.6s ease-out transition on scroll intersection
- **Threshold**: 0.1 (triggers when 10% visible)
- **Root margin**: '-50px' (triggers 50px before viewport)

## ✅ Final Checks Completed
- ✅ Hero animation plays once and doesn't repeat
- ✅ Wine cards animate smoothly on scroll
- ✅ Staggered cascading effect implemented
- ✅ Accessibility and performance optimized
- ✅ No layout or interactivity interference

The animation system is production-ready! 🍷
